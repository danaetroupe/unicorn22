ABOUT:
This simple graphics demo showcases both C++ and the rendering capabilities of the SDL2 Graphics Library. 
It features an animated sprite that is controlled by user input (Up, Left, Down, Right, Shift) that walks around the screen, cycling
through a range of motion determined by the key press. The shift key causes the animation process and the swiftness of which it moves
accross the screen to increase. Letting go of the shift key returns the animation to its default values. Behind the sprite, the demo
features a map created in the tiled software, featuring game art that was avaliable for public use, that contains several properties.
Most notable of these properties is the bounding boxes overlayed on top of objects such as trees and rocks. The sprite, when it comes 
in contact with these bounding boxes, experiences a collission and is unable onto that part of the map. 

The movement of the demo itself is also unique in that both the map and the sprite have the capability to move depending on the sprite's location
on the map. When the map reaches the edge of the screen, it can no longer scroll and the player is able to move accross the screen. The sprite
is unable to move past the edge of the screen, either experiencing a collission or reaactivating the movement of the map. 

Some things that I picked up for future projects:
   - I could've spent more time working in C++ without SDL so that I can better organize the code (e.g splitting classes into multiple files,
	creating less dependency between classes...)
   - Pointers/References are very useful and crucial in C++
   - I would like to spend more time researching game architecture and game design patterns
   - The location of project libraries is important. I would probably organize the necessary files into the project folder
	itself.  
   - Take more time to familarie myself with C++ naming conventions to encourage consistency accross the code
   - Learn the Visual Studio debugging tools earlier on as they came in handy throughout the late stages of the process
